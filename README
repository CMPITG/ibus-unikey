Description
-----------

ibus-unikey is an ibus input method engine.
It uses a modified version of UkEngine for processing key events.

-----
Notes
-----

You should use the version provided by your distro's repository.  If
you distro does not have it, contact the authors to get one.

This version of ibus-unikey does NOT work with applications which does
not support text surrounding (e.g. some available terminals).  The
preedit fallback method is being developed to have them supported as
well.
